# 🌌 IEEE IGDTUW Galactic Hub  
### Futuristic Event & Community Platform

A cinematic, space-themed web application built for IEEE IGDTUW to manage events, recruitment, engagement, and institutional memory through an immersive UI/UX experience.

This project combines modern frontend engineering, motion design, and AI-assisted workflows to deliver a deployable and scalable student-branch platform.
